# Sarthi.ai — Canonical PRD v4.1

**Version:** 4.1  
**Date:** March 2026  
**Status:** Single Source of Truth

---

## 1. The One-Line Definition

```
Sarthi is the autonomous back-office for any company that has
outgrown spreadsheets but cannot yet afford a team of specialists.

It does not advise. It works.
It does not build dashboards. It acts on what it sees.
It does not wait to be asked. It tells you what matters.

Finance. Accounting. Bookkeeping. Legal. Compliance.
Business Intelligence. Market Intelligence.
All of it. Running continuously. In the background.
Delivered as a message — not a login.
```

---

## 2. The Problem

| What a Startup Needs | What They Actually Have |
|---------------------|------------------------|
| CFO | Founder checking a spreadsheet at 11pm |
| Head of HR | Founder copying an offer letter template |
| Legal counsel | Founder ignoring the contract renewal email |
| BI analyst | Founder not knowing what they don't know |
| COO | Founder doing everything manually |

**The result:** 15–20 hours/week of founder time eaten by back-office work that doesn't require their unique judgment. That is ~3 months/year of product and growth time permanently lost.

---

## 3. The ICP

### Who Sarthi Is For

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Stage** | Pre-seed → Series A |
| **Team size** | 1–25 people |
| **Type** | Product/tech startup (B2B SaaS, D2C, marketplace, fintech, edtech) |
| **Geography** | India (beachhead) → US → UK → EU → SEA |

### Jurisdiction Awareness

Sarthi detects which laws apply based on company incorporation profile at onboarding:

- **India:** GST, TDS, PF, ESIC, PT, MCA, DPDP
- **US:** Sales tax, SBIR/STTR grants, QSBS, 409A, SOC2
- **UK:** VAT, Innovate UK grants, Companies House
- **EU:** VAT OSS, GDPR, Horizon Europe grants
- **SEA:** SST (Malaysia), GST (Singapore), BOI (Thailand)

### What Defines Them

- Tech-literate — they know what an API is
- Already using tools (Notion, Linear, Razorpay, Google Workspace, Zoho Books/QuickBooks)
- Do NOT have dedicated ops/finance/HR/legal hires
- The founder IS the back-office right now

### What They Feel

- "I'm spending all my time on admin, not product"
- "I don't know if my numbers are okay"
- "I almost missed a GST deadline last month"
- "I have to write the same follow-up emails every single week"

### What They Need

- Not the best financial firm
- Not another dashboard
- Someone (something) to hold their hand, handle the grunt work, and tell them the one thing that matters right now

---

## 4. Global TAM

| Market | Current | 2030 | CAGR |
|--------|---------|------|------|
| AI Agents | $7.8B | $52.6B | 46.3% |
| AI Policy & Governance | $1.3B | $39.5B | 40.0% |
| Accounting services startups | $8.2B | $14.1B | 14.5% |

**Sarthi SAM:** ~135M companies globally with 1–100 employees, outgrown Excel, cannot afford specialists. At $50/month = **$81B/year addressable**.

---

## 5. The Interface

### Primary: Telegram Bot

Free, no per-message cost, async, file-capable, inline keyboards for HITL approvals. Works globally.

### What Founders Send Sarthi

- **Text questions:** "What's my runway?"
- **CSV/Excel files:** Bank statement export from net banking
- **PDF files:** Contracts, notices, invoices
- **Photos:** Tax notices, receipts, whiteboards
- **/commands:** `/status` `/runway` `/pipeline` `/decisions` `/weekly`

### What Sarthi Sends Founders

- **Proactive alerts** (unprompted, when score > threshold)
- **Task reports:** "Done: sent 3 payment reminders"
- **HITL requests:** "Send this to Raju? [Yes / Edit / No]"
- **Weekly briefing:** Every Monday 9am local time
- **Deadline alerts:** 14-day advance warning on all compliance

---

## 6. The BI Replacement Layer

| Excel / Power BI | Sarthi |
|-----------------|--------|
| Founder opens tool | Sarthi watches 24/7 |
| Refresh to see data | Sarthi pushes when it matters |
| Founder spots anomaly | Sarthi spots it first |
| Export for investor | Sarthi generates narrative |
| Manual scenario math | "What if I hire in April?" answered against live data |
| Rear-view snapshot | Rolling 13-week forward forecast |
| Static chart | "At current trajectory: zero June 14" |

**Every agent in Sarthi is a living BI query. Not a chart. A decision.**

---

## 7. The Agent Architecture

### Tier Map

```
TIER 0  ── KERNEL (Go + Temporal)
           BusinessOSWorkflow: orchestrates all agents,
           enforces HITL gates, maintains audit trail,
           never crashes, never loses state.

TIER 1  ── CHIEF OF STAFF (1 agent — Python/LangGraph)
           The ONLY agent that talks to the founder.
           Routes, translates, decides what to surface.
           Holds the full company knowledge graph.

TIER 2  ── INTELLIGENCE (observe + advise, NEVER talk to founder)
           These agents produce typed findings → CoS decides.

TIER 3  ── OPERATIONS (execute, not just advise)
           Owner approves → agent executes autonomously.

TIER 4  ── DATA LAYER (invisible — founder never interacts)
           Normalizes inputs, manages memory,
           crawls external intelligence.
```

### Tier 1: Chief of Staff

- **LangGraph graph:** `chief_of_staff_agent.py`
- **DSPy signatures:** ToneFilter, RouteClassifier
- **Pydantic output:** `ChiefOfStaffOutput`
- **Single entrypoint** for all founder communication
- **Routes** inbound messages to Tier 2/3 agents
- **Scores** all findings: fire now / queue / suppress
- **Applies ToneFilter:** jargon → plain language
- **Manages conversation memory** (Qdrant + Neo4j)
- **Monday 9am weekly briefing** (Temporal cron)
- **Enforces:** one message = one action only

**HITL Gate:**
- **LOW RISK** → auto-execute + notify after
- **MEDIUM RISK** → 1-tap Telegram inline keyboard
- **HIGH RISK** → explicit confirm with context

## 8. The Self-Correcting Loop

```
1. Agent acts      (e.g. sends payment reminder to Client X)
2. Outcome seen    (Client X pays in 24 hours)
3. MemoryAgent writes to Qdrant:
   "Client X: high responsiveness, 24hr payment"
4. GraphMemoryAgent writes episode to Neo4j:
   Entity: Client X → RELATION: responds_within → 24h
5. Future: warmer tone, earlier follow-up,
   CoS knows not to escalate this client
6. Context drift:  CoS detects macro pattern across
   all memory and surfaces unprompted:
   "You've raised prices twice but win rate is unchanged
    — your pricing has headroom."

The system gets smarter about THIS company specifically.
Not generic AI. Company-specific intelligence that compounds.
```

## 10. The Tone Contract

### BANNED IN ALL OUTPUT (every agent, every message)

```
EBITDA, DSO, bps, YoY, MoM, liquidity,
working capital, CAGR, accounts receivable,
burn multiple, runway compression, NWC,
cash conversion cycle, churn cohort delta,
basis points, net margin, gross margin,
accounts payable, amortization, depreciation,
optimize, leverage, synergy, streamline,
actionable insights, KPIs, metrics, data-driven
```

### REQUIRED IN ALL OUTPUT

- Lead with human reality, not the metric
- Max 3 sentences of explanation
- End with exactly ONE action
- Warm, direct — trusted friend, not consultant
- If bad news: acknowledge before data
- If good news: celebrate explicitly first

### Example

**BAD:** "Your EBITDA margin compressed 340bps MoM due to elevated SG&A spend."

**GOOD:** "You kept less money from every rupee you earned this month — costs grew faster than revenue. The main culprit is [specific line]. This week: cut or pause [specific item]."

**Enforced via:**
1. Pydantic validator on every output model
2. DSPy-compiled ToneFilter (compiled weights in git)
3. Langfuse scores every output — <0.7 is flagged

---

## 11. The HITL Gate Model

| Risk Level | Examples | Approval Flow |
|------------|----------|--------------|
| **LOW RISK** (auto-execute + notify after) | Categorize a transaction, Update a CRM record, Log a compliance deadline, Generate a draft document (not yet sent) | Auto |
| **MEDIUM RISK** (1-tap Telegram inline keyboard) | Send a message to a client, Send a payment reminder, Book a meeting, Share a document externally | 1-tap |
| **HIGH RISK** (explicit confirm + reason shown) | File a GST return, Send a legal document, Make a payment, Delete or archive data, Submit a grant application | Explicit confirm |

**PRINCIPLE:** Powerful but never autonomous where it matters. The founder always controls the wheel. They just don't have to steer on empty roads.

## 14. Testing Architecture

**PRINCIPLE:** Real Docker. Real LLM. No mocks. Always.

| Layer | Tool | What Is Tested |
|-------|------|---------------|
| **Infra** | conftest.py poison pill | All 12 Docker containers reachable before any test. LLM confirmed live. Mock patches on LLM BLOCKED |
| **Agent graphs** | LangGraph + pytest-asyncio | Graph completes all nodes. State transitions valid. Error nodes reachable |
| **Output contracts** | Pydantic v2 | Every finding typed. Jargon validator fires. Structure enforced at boundary |
| **Prompt quality** | DSPy + BootstrapFewShot + compiled JSON | Score ≥ 0.7 on holdout examples. CFO runway within ±15 days. ToneFilter jargon-free |
| **Observability** | Langfuse self-hosted | Every LangGraph node traced. Scores logged per run. Trace visible in UI |
| **E2E flows** | Full stack | Telegram → Go → Redpanda → Temporal → Python agent → Pydantic output → Langfuse trace → Telegram delivery |

### Test Count Targets

| Suite | Tests | Type |
|-------|-------|------|

## 17. What Does Not Change (v4.0 → v4.1)

```
Telegram as primary interface          ✅ correct globally
HITL gate model                        ✅ required everywhere
OSS bootstrapped stack ($0/mo)         ✅ structural cost advantage
ToneFilter jargon-free output          ✅ universal
Real Docker + Real LLM test rule       ✅ non-negotiable
Agent hierarchy Tier 0–4               ✅ correct architecture
Pydantic output contracts              ✅ type safety is not geography
DSPy prompt optimization               ✅ works globally
Langfuse observability                 ✅ works globally
Universal OpenAI SDK (no AzureOpenAI)  ✅ enforced
Neo4j + Graphiti memory layer          ✅ locked in
v4.0.0 tag condition                   ✅ first real founder, not code
```

## 18. The Moat

1. **INDIA-FIRST COMPLIANCE DEPTH**
   GST/TDS/PF/ESIC/PT/DPDP/MCA — no US tool will build this. No enterprise vendor will price it for pre-seed founders.

2. **COMPANY-SPECIFIC MEMORY (Qdrant + Neo4j)**
   After 6 months: "You've done this exact stall pattern 3 times. Here's what broke it last time." Graphiti makes this possible. A competitor starting fresh has to rebuild from zero.

3. **$0/MONTH INFRASTRUCTURE**
   Docker OSS stack. 85%+ gross margins at scale. Competitors on managed cloud can't price this low.

4. **THE RELATIONSHIP COMPOUNDS**
   Trust between founder and Sarthi grows every week. Every intervention, rating, and outcome improves the model for this specific company. Not transferable.

5. **BRAND POSITIONING ENTERPRISE CAN'T COPY**
   No enterprise vendor can say "don't worry, I've got this" to a scared 26-year-old founder at 11pm. Their legal team, brand, and sales motion won't allow it.

6. **GRANT DETECTION = FOUND MONEY**
   "There's a ₹40 lakh DPIIT grant you qualify for." No other tool watches this continuously per company. First time Sarthi finds a grant the founder didn't know about — that's lifetime retention.

## 19. Success Metrics

### Week 1 with real founder:
- Onboarding completed < 10 minutes
- First bank statement processed < 30 seconds
- First CFO finding delivered, zero jargon
- At least one action approved via Telegram inline key

### Month 1:
- 5+ hours/week saved (founder-reported)
- Zero compliance deadlines missed
- ≥ 3 Finance Ops tasks executed autonomously
- DSPy eval score ≥ 0.75 maintained
- All Langfuse traces < 8s p95

### The real metric:
**"Would you recommend Sarthi to another founder?"**

**Target:** 8/10 by founder #5.
