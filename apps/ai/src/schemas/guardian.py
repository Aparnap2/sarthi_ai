"""
Pydantic output contracts for Sarthi v3.0 Guardian Agent.

These schemas enforce strict output contracts for the Guardian:
- AlertDecision: Cognitive decision only — should alert or not
- GuardianMessage: Final narrative only — human-readable alert
- Word-limit validation on all user-facing text
- injected_numbers: Audit trail for numbers from data sources (never from LLM)

Usage:
    from src.schemas.guardian import AlertDecision, GuardianMessage
    
    decision = AlertDecision(
        should_alert=True,
        severity="critical",
        primary_signal="Payment failed 3 times",
        context_note="Customer tried paying for annual subscription"
    )
    
    message = GuardianMessage(
        pattern_name="failed_payment_retry",
        insight="Customer attempted to pay 3 times for annual subscription. All attempts failed due to card decline.",
        urgency_horizon="today",
        one_action="Refund the failed payments and email customer with alternative payment options",
        injected_numbers=["3", "2", "7500"]
